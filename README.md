Hi, Iâ€™m @astrollacrosstheuniverse and I am interested in contributing to open source Astronomy projects.
I have a degree in Astronomy and physics and am working as an Engineer, so already work with a lot of SW development.
I plan to contribute to Astropy, by learning the basics about the Sw package and then develop some of the basic fixes and features in the log
